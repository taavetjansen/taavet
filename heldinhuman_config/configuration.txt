I never looked at what kind of tree it was.<br>It didn’t have a species name, it was as if<br>I was more amazed by the will to live of a<br>tree as such rather than that of a birch or a<br>maple. Perhaps that’s how I look at people<br>too – the conditions are impossible yet the<br>person lives. Their name or where they’re<br>from seems secondary. It’s as if there’s<br>neither tree nor person if they don’t force<br>their way through rubble and circumstances.
